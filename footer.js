		<h3>About</h3> \
\
            <p> <a href="http://programsfor.me">ProgramsFor.Me</a> aims to help more people express their ideas through programming.  Today, the web browser you are using has everything you need to make cool stuff, like video games, interactive 3D visualizations, and even robot controllers.  To take advantage of the power of programming, you do need to be able to communicate your ideas to the computer.</p>  \
\
<p>Your web browser can understand JavaScript, so learning JavaScript gives you the power to have the computer do things for you.  There are many sites and tutorials that help help you learn JavaScript and other programming languages.  But it does not stop there.  We still need math and physics to make cool things happen, like simulating the motion of spring, controlling robots, testing collisions in a video game, and creating game enemies with artifical intelligence.  This is a lot of stuff to learn, but is totally worth it. <p>  \
\
<p>ProgramsFor.Me provides a few examples to help you along your way.  Every example program has source code that can be immediately modified for you to see what happens, and eventually start to build your own programs. </p>\
